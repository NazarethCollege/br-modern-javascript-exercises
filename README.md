# [Build Right: Modern Javascript][modern-js] Exercises 

## Prerequisites

1. [Node 6.x][node]
  
  Node 7 is available, but many have encountered issues with it. For that
  reason, we still are recommending node 6 - at least for this workshop.

  To check your version of node, run `node -v`. You should see v6.##.#.

  To install node@6 using [Homebrew],
  ```
  brew install node@6
  brew unlink node
  brew link node@6 --force
  ```

2. Git

  While not absolutely necessary, we recommend using Git to clone this
  repository.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or Download this repository

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/sparkbox/br-modern-javascript-exercises.git
  ```

2. `cd br-modern-javascript-exercises`

3. Grab some popcorn and enjoy the show!
